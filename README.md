# CausalityChecker: Usage

## Installation

```gmake distclean && gmake all```

## Running

Just type:

## Generating Animations

You can run the causality check analysis and generate animations of the results automatically by typing:

The output files (or the sub-directories containing them) will be stored in the same directory that the file to check is located.
